# FPGA and deep neural network-accelerated spatial-spectral interferometry for rapid optical dispersion analysis  
#### Abstract:
##### spatial-spectral interferometry (SSI) is a technique used to reconstruct the electrial field of an ultrafast laser. By analyzing the spectral phase distribution, SSI provides valuable information
